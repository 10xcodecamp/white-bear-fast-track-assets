# White Bear Assets

Here you will finds assets to help you prototype your spaced-repetition note-taking app, White Bear. Follow these guidelines as if you were given them by a design department.

Copy the code from `style/theme.scss` in this repository and place it in the `theme.scss` file in your project.

Download the icons and images and place them into your `icons` and `images` folders.

Review the screenshots in the `screenshots` folder. Try to match the mockups but watch the video for this project where I explain that sometimes it is okay to deviate from the mockups in the interest of releasing code faster.

## Font sizes and structure of HTML elements

`<h1>` - White Bear logo text on the landing page

`<h2>` - Card titles on landing page

`<h3>` - White Bear logo text in the app

`<h4>` - Centered text above card

`class="lead"` - the class to increase the size of text on cards to 20px (used on every card except cards in "All cards" view, which have standard 16px text)

`<p>` - standard  text in the app

## File structure

The project should have 8 HTML pages that are linked together as described in [Prototyping the User Experience of White Bear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2M-jRUNgB4&list=PLa5bYMAqOz6Mv5ohqx3Eu80y7uv-_0YIk&index=7&t=0s):
